# Overview

BAN, Blockchain Accelerating Network, is an accelerating network published by BaishanCloud. BAN is mainly used for public blockchain platform. BAN provides a network with many geographically located EOS nodes - thus Dapps (Decentralized Applications) can accomplish a fast access to the APIs provided by these full EOS nodes in BAN services. Dapps then can use these APIs to query block info, publish smart contract and push transactions to EOS network. In the remaining part of this guide, we will demonstrate BAN services to you with the EOS official `cleos` command line tool.
